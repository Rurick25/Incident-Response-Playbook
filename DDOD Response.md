  ## Scope: 
  ### **Defining the types of DDoS attacks.**  
  **- Volumetric DDoS** attacks aim to overwhelm the target's resources, such as network bandwidth,  
    server capacity, or database functionality, by flooding them with massive amounts of traffic or requests.  
    The primary goal is to saturate the victim site's bandwidth, making it inaccessible to legitimate users.  
    The attack magnitude is typically measured in bits per second (bps), reflecting the volume of data being sent.   
    
**- Protocol (Misuse of IT Protocols)** Protocol attacks exploit weaknesses in the design or implementation of communication protocols, aiming to consume server or network resources, interrupt service, or cause system malfunctions. These attacks typically target specific layers of the OSI model (often the network or transport layers) and manipulate the way protocols handle legitimate traffic, often with minimal traffic volume required.

**- Application (misuse of application features.** Application layer attacks target the functionality of specific applications and services by exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses in how those applications handle traffic. Unlike volumetric or protocol-based attacks, which focus on overwhelming a system with sheer volume or exploiting protocol weaknesses, application layer attacks aim to consume server resources by triggering costly or inefficient operations.
These attacks are often more difficult to detect because they mimic legitimate user behavior and target specific features of applications. As a result, application layer attacks tend to be more sophisticated and stealthy.

## Step by Step
  ### Detection

#### DDoS Attack Indicators   
 - **Unusual Traffic Patterns:** DDoS attacks typically generate abnormal traffic volumes that deviate significantly from the usual patterns observed on a network or server. These patterns may include:
   - Traffic Spikes: A sudden surge in traffic without any corresponding increase in legitimate user activity.
   - Geographically Distributed Traffic: A large volume of requests from unexpected or widespread geographic locations, often from countries where the service has little to no user base.
   - Frequent Requests from Single IPs: An unusually high number of requests coming from a small number of IP addresses or subnets, indicating potential botnet or automated attack activity.
   - Traffic to Specific Endpoints: Unusual increases in requests targeting specific URLs, APIs, or services that are not typically high-traffic areas.
- **Service Availability Issues (500/503 Errors):** DDoS attacks often overwhelm the server’s ability to process requests, leading to:
  - HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error): This error indicates that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. This can occur when server resources, like database connections, are exhausted.
  - HTTP 503 (Service Unavailable): This error means that the server is currently unable to handle the request due to being temporarily overloaded or undergoing maintenance. In the case of a DDoS attack, the overload is typically the result of excessive traffic.
  - Intermittent Outages: Services may become intermittently available, responding to some requests but failing for others, as the server struggles to keep up with the attack.
- **High CPU and Memory Usage:** A common consequence of a DDoS attack is the extreme consumption of server resources, leading to:
    - CPU Spikes: The server's processor usage skyrockets as it tries to manage the overwhelming number of incoming requests. This can cause legitimate processes to slow down or fail.
    - Memory Exhaustion: Memory resources are quickly consumed, often leading to the system running out of RAM, which can cause application crashes, swapping, or the server becoming unresponsive.
    - System Logs: Logs may show repeated errors or warnings about resource limits being exceeded, failed processes, or services being restarted to cope with the load.
    - Server Throttling: In some cases, automatic throttling mechanisms may kick in to prevent complete system failure, but this can lead to degraded performance and service disruptions.
  
#### Tools and alerts:
- Set up alerts for unusual traffic spikes
  - Network Monitoring Tools (e.g., Nagios, Zabbix): Configure these tools to continuously monitor traffic levels and trigger alerts when thresholds, such as bandwidth usage or connection rates, exceed normal operating ranges.
  - Log Analysis Tools (e.g., Splunk, ELK Stack): Set up automated alerts in log analysis platforms to notify administrators when logs show unusually high traffic to specific ports or from a single IP range.
  - Cloud Monitoring Services (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor): Utilize cloud provider tools to monitor and alert on traffic spikes, especially for services hosted in the cloud.
- Use inline Packet Inspection and Traffic Flow Analysis
  - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) (e.g., Snort, Suricata): These systems inspect packet contents against known attack signatures. They can be configured to detect and alert on patterns typical of DDoS attacks, such as malformed packets or repeated requests.
  - Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs): NGFWs combine deep packet inspection with traffic flow analysis to differentiate between legitimate and malicious traffic. These firewalls can block malicious traffic inline and prevent it from reaching the server.
  - sFlow/NetFlow Analysis: Use flow analysis tools to gain a high-level overview of traffic behavior. Flow data helps in detecting unusual traffic patterns such as a sudden increase in connections to specific ports or from numerous IP addresses.
  - AI-Powered Solutions (e.g., Darktrace): Some advanced systems use machine learning to establish baseline traffic patterns and automatically detect deviations that may indicate DDoS attacks.
  
  #### Actions to take:
- Confirm the attack using logs and monitoring dashboards: Before escalating the response, it is critical to confirm that the anomaly is indeed a DDoS attack and not a false positive or a benign traffic spike.
  - Check Network Logs: Use tools like Splunk, ELK Stack, or native logging in firewalls and routers to review logs for traffic patterns that indicate a DDoS attack. Look for:
    - High volumes of requests from multiple IP addresses (indicating a distributed attack).
    - Repeated requests to a single endpoint or port (common in application-layer DDoS).
  - Review Monitoring Dashboards: Utilize network performance dashboards (e.g., Nagios, Zabbix, SolarWinds) to visualize the spike in traffic and identify whether it's targeting specific services, servers, or ports.
Dashboards often provide real-time views of bandwidth usage, connection counts, and error rates, which can help confirm the attack.
  - Analyze Packet Captures: Tools like Wireshark can be used to capture and inspect network packets for signs of malicious behavior such as SYN floods, malformed packets, or unusual payloads.
  - Outcome: This confirmation step ensures that the response is appropriate, preventing unnecessary escalations or disruptions if the spike is due to legitimate traffic increases (e.g., a flash crowd scenario).
- Notify the IRT (Incident Response team): Once the attack is confirmed, prompt notification of the Incident Response Team (IRT) ensures a coordinated and swift response, minimizing the attack’s impact on the organization.
  - Use Communication Protocols: Follow predefined communication protocols to alert the IRT. This typically includes sending out alerts via incident management platforms (e.g., ServiceNow, PagerDuty), email, or messaging apps.
  - Provide Detailed Information: Include the following details in the notification to give the IRT a clear picture of the situation:
    - Type of attack: SYN flood, UDP flood, HTTP GET flood, etc.
    - Affected systems: Specific servers, services, or network segments.
    - Time of detection: When the attack was first noticed.
    - Initial impact: Service outages, slowdowns, or any observed user impact.
    - Activate the Incident Response Plan: This may involve calling in additional support, engaging third-party DDoS mitigation services, or escalating to senior management depending on the severity of the attack. 
- Outcome: Timely notification ensures that all necessary personnel are mobilized and that resources are allocated efficiently to mitigate the attack.

  - Traffic Characteristics:
    - SYN Flood: Look for a high number of SYN packets with incomplete TCP handshakes.
    - UDP Flood: Examine for large volumes of UDP packets, especially to ports with no associated services.
    - HTTP Flood: Identify a surge in HTTP GET or POST requests targeting specific web resources.
    - Amplification Attacks: Detect disproportionate response sizes compared to request sizes, indicating protocols like NTP or DNS are being abused.
- Outcome: A clear identification of the attack vector allows targeted defenses such as rate limiting, filtering, or specific protocol handling.
- Examine traffic sources and patterns: Understanding the origins and distribution of the attack traffic helps in assessing the scope and scale of the attack, as well as in blocking or mitigating the malicious sources. 
- Steps:
  - Source IP Analysis:
    - Distributed Attack: Identify whether the attack traffic is coming from a wide range of IP addresses (e.g., botnets) or a concentrated set (e.g., single IP or small cluster).
    - Geo-Location Mapping: Use geo-location tools to map the origin of the IP addresses to understand if the attack is localized or global.
  - Traffic Volume and Timing:
    - Pattern Recognition: Analyze the volume of traffic over time to detect if the attack follows certain patterns or intervals, which could indicate automated tools or scripts.
    - Peak Analysis: Identify peak times of traffic surges to understand the attack’s intensity and timing.
  - Packet Analysis: Check for anomalies in packet size and payload, which can signal specific attack techniques like fragmentation or payload-based attacks.
  - Outcome: Detailed knowledge of traffic sources and patterns aids in implementing focused blocks (e.g., IP blacklisting, geo-blocking) and understanding the attacker’s strategy.
   #### Analysis Tools
    - **Wireshark:** Utilize Wireshark for deep packet inspection to analyze the captured network traffic during the attack. Look for patterns, payload sizes, and specific ports or protocols that were targeted.       
   Application:
      - Filter traffic based on source IP addresses, protocols (e.g., UDP, TCP), or specific port numbers.
      - Identify payload anomalies and repetitive patterns that could indicate the type of DDoS attack (e.g., SYN flood, UDP flood).
        
   - **tcpdump** Use tcpdump to capture raw network traffic data directly from the command line for further analysis or as input to Wireshark. Application:
        - Capture live traffic to specific ports or from specific IP addresses to isolate malicious activity.
        - Export captured traffic for offline analysis or long-term storage.
        
   -  **Splunk**: Leverage Splunk for aggregating and analyzing system logs, application logs, and network traffic data to trace the origin and behavior of the DDoS attack.
    - Search for high-frequency IP addresses, repeated requests, or unusual patterns in logs.
    - Create visual dashboards to illustrate traffic trends and highlight anomalies during the attack period.

  - **Threat Intelligence Platforms (e.g., ThreatConnect, Recorded Future)**: Consult threat intelligence platforms to correlate the observed attack patterns with known DDoS campaigns or threat actors.
    - Identify if the IP addresses or attack vectors have been associated with previous DDoS incidents.
    - Update internal threat intelligence databases with new indicators of compromise (IoCs) from the attack.
  
  - **Network Analyzer Tools (e.g., SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor)**: Use network analyzer tools to monitor network performance metrics in real-time and retrospectively during the attack window.
    - Analyze traffic flow to detect bottlenecks, saturation points, and affected segments of the network.
    - Generate reports to understand the performance impact of the DDoS attack on critical services.

### Containment
To swiftly limit the impact of the DDoS attack by reducing the volume of malicious traffic reaching the targeted systems, thereby preserving the availability of services for legitimate users.
  #### Immediate Actions
1. Implement Rate Limiting on Routers and Firewalls: Rate limiting helps to control the flow of traffic to the server by setting thresholds on the number of requests or packets that can be handled over a specific period. This prevents the network from becoming overwhelmed by excessive traffic volumes.
Steps:
- Set Rate Limits: Configure routers and firewalls to limit the rate of incoming traffic. For example:
  - Per IP Rate Limiting: Limit the number of connections or requests allowed from a single IP address within a set timeframe.
  - Per Port Rate Limiting: Apply rate limits on specific ports that are being targeted, such as HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443).
- Dynamic Adjustments: Monitor the attack's evolution and adjust rate limits dynamically to balance between mitigating the attack and maintaining access for legitimate users.
Tools: Most modern routers and firewalls, such as Cisco, Juniper, or Fortinet, support rate limiting configurations. Use their management interfaces or CLI to set appropriate thresholds.
Outcome: Reduced load on the network and server infrastructure, preventing them from being overwhelmed by the attack traffic.

2. Block Malicious IPs Using Access Control Lists (ACLs)
Purpose: Blocking known malicious IP addresses at the network edge using ACLs can immediately stop some attack traffic before it reaches internal networks or servers.
- Steps:
  - Identify Malicious IPs: Use logs, traffic analysis tools, or third-party threat intelligence feeds to compile a list of IP addresses involved in the attack.
  - Configure ACLs:
    - Ingress ACLs: Apply rules on routers or switches to block incoming traffic from identified malicious IP addresses. 
    - Egress ACLs: In some cases, apply egress ACLs to prevent internal resources from responding to spoofed IP addresses. 
  - Update Regularly: Continuously update ACLs as new malicious IPs are identified during the attack to maintain effectiveness.
  - Automation: Use tools or scripts to automate the addition of malicious IPs to ACLs to ensure rapid response.
- Outcome: Immediate reduction in attack traffic by preventing packets from known malicious sources from entering the network.

Action Steps:
- Configure rate limiting on routers and firewalls to control the volume of incoming traffic, applying limits per IP or per port as necessary.
- Block malicious IP addresses using ACLs on network devices, ensuring that identified sources of attack traffic are swiftly neutralized.
